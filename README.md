Students in CMS 120 have come to tutoring sessions with several consistent issues. For
instance, students write algorithms with incorrect data types for the variables they use. This type
of issue comes from how Python is formatted (not making programmers declare data types on
assignment/declaration) and obfuscates details from programmers. Although the format of
Python is oriented towards making programming easier, beginners do not inherently learn
necessary concepts because the language covers up many aspects of programming complexity
for the sake of ease of use.
